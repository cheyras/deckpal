## 2026-07-28 — Tier boundary synced to pkmn + prices + runbook (23/23 sets exact)

Closed out the three residuals from the import so the collection is **completely** faithful:

- **Tier sync** (one-off script, removed). pkmn's per-card `variantMap[key].type`
  (`Primary`=Master / `Secondary`=Grandmaster-only) is the authoritative pack-pulled
  boundary. Ingested it into `variant_tier_override` (card-scoped, `asserted_by=
  'pkmn.gg-tier-sync'`) wherever our derived v3 rule disagreed — **260 overrides**. Two
  legitimate patterns (both correct, documented in the runbook §4): (1) holo-rare `normal`
  → Secondary (~40, e.g. me01 Hariyama/Lunatone — fixed the earlier me01 Master −2);
  (2) WOTC 1st-edition → Primary for Jungle/Fossil/Team Rocket (~209 — pkmn counts BOTH
  unlimited and 1st-ed printings as Master; Base Set is the exception since its 1st-ed is
  *also* Shadowless, correctly staying Secondary). Result: **23/23 owned sets now match
  pkmn.gg exactly on Complete + Master + Grandmaster** (verified at import time).
- **Prices.** Re-ran the TCGCSV ingest; the modelled standard variants (83 reverse + 9 holo
  with TCGplayer ids) are now priced. The ~11 promo variants without a TCGplayer id stay
  unpriced by design (no invented prices — SCHEMA §4.6).
- **New `card_variant.source` value `pkmn.gg`** added to the CHECK constraint;
  one new `variant_kind` `holo-stamp-trick-or-trade`.
- **Runbook** — the full procedure for a future agent on each new release (fetch pkmn
  variantMap → model missing variants → tier-sync → price → import → verify against
  set-stats), with the tier nuances and per-step undo. The scraper scripts and runbook
  have been removed from the repo (see 2026-08-09 privacy scrub).
