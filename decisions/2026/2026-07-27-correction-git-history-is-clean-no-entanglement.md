## 2026-07-27 — Correction: git history is clean (no entanglement)
An earlier note called e0e5fd4 "entangled" from the concurrent Phase 7/8 commit race.
**Verified false:** e0e5fd4 contains scanner files ONLY (apps/api/scan, index.ts,
migration 016, package.json); bb46766 (PWA) and 7ace0c6 (web wave) each contain 0
non-web files. The scanner agent's `reset --mixed` + scoped re-commit fully corrected
the race; the transient bad SHA (7e5237d) never survived into history. Nothing to fix.
