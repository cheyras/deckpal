## 2026-07-24 — Sprites are fetched, never committed
**Decided by:** lead agent (flagged by dex research; user may override).
**Decision:** Pokémon sprites and official artwork are pulled at setup time by a
fetch script pinned to a specific `PokeAPI/sprites` commit SHA, into the same
kind of local cache as card art. They are **not** vendored into the git repo.

**Why:** `PokeAPI/sprites/LICENCE.txt` asserts CC0 1.0 on one line and
"All image contents within are Copyright The Pokémon Company" on the next —
CC0 applied to work the applier does not own, so the CC0 grant is not the
author's to make. Card art is in exactly the same position. Caching Nintendo/TPC
assets on your own disk for personal use is the brief's accepted posture;
*committing* them into a publicly-reachable git repo is a materially different
act. Keeping them out of git costs us nothing (a sparse
blobless checkout is ~270 MB and scripted) and removes the question entirely.

**Implications:** setup is a documented two-step (clone, then `fetch-assets`).
Backup/restore must cover the asset cache separately from the DB, and the
restore drill must prove a fresh Pi can re-fetch.
