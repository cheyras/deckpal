## 2026-07-24 — Remote access: existing reverse proxy + SSO
**Decided by:** user.
**Decision:** pokedex will be reachable remotely via a route on the existing
public-hostname nginx vhost, gated by the SSO layer — the same pattern the
other services on this host already use. Tailscale will **not** be installed.

**Implications:**
- No new daemon on the host; reuses a proven, already-operating pattern.
- The app binds to localhost / LAN only; nginx is the sole ingress.
- The app itself needs no login of its own — the SSO gate is the auth boundary.
  It must therefore never be bound to `0.0.0.0` on a routable interface.
- LAN access goes through the LAN vhost as usual.
- Requires a new `location` block in both the public and LAN nginx vhosts.
  **Do not reload nginx without asking the user** (other co-hosted services
  depend on it).
