## 2026-08-09 — Open-source readiness pass (post-scrub)

**Decided by:** user directive ("get this repo fully ready for open source collaboration"); executed by an orchestrated agent wave.

**What landed (four commits after the privacy scrub):**
1. **Security/portability** — MCP `allowedHosts` moved to `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` env (localhost-only default; prod hosts now in `.env`); `?key=` query auth fallback removed (header only — nginx injects it, so prod unaffected); card-image handler now validates path params like the set handler; 500/health responses no longer leak `err.message`; blanket `cors()` replaced with off-by-default + `API_CORS_ORIGINS` allowlist (SPA is same-origin, MCP calls server-side — nothing needed it); repo-relative config defaults; parameterized the `goal` FILTER in mcp catalog; partition-name validation in prices DDL; per-IP rate limit on POST /bugs; `cors` dep dropped.
2. **Docs** — README rewritten (was claiming "Phase 2, no frontend"); ARCHITECTURE refreshed (+mcp, +dev tooling); rename stragglers fixed; `"license": "AGPL-3.0-only"` in all 7 package.json files.
3. **Contributor surface** — AGENTS.md (the ten portable engineering contracts + verification standards), CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md (deployment model: API/images have no auth by design — reverse proxy required), CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, `.env.example`, issue/PR templates. CLAUDE.md slimmed to deployment-specific operational detail.
4. **CI** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` mirroring the prior CI pipeline (db build first, typecheck, pure tests, app builds); every step verified locally before commit.

**Discovered: the DeckPal rename was never deployed.** Current code mounts `/deckpal/*` (since the rename commit), but the live nginx fragments still route `/pokedex/*`, and the running processes are a pre-rename build serving `/pokedex/api` (verified: `:3700/pokedex/api/health` -> 200, `/deckpal/api/health` -> 404). **Restart hazard:** `dist/` on disk is now post-rename, so an unplanned process restart/reboot would boot `/deckpal` code behind `/pokedex` nginx routes and take the app down. The cutover (edit conf fragments to `/deckpal/`, rebuild, restart all, nginx reload, re-install PWA on phone since the start URL changes) needs the user's OK per the shared-infra rule — deliberately NOT done in this pass. `.env` carries both `POKEDEX_*` (read by the running build) and `DECKPAL_*` (read by current code) until then.

**Still open (user decisions):** history rewrite for the already-public pre-scrub commits; the Poké Ball/wordmark app icons; the nginx cutover above.
