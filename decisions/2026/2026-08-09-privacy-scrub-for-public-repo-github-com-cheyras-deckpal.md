## 2026-08-09 — Privacy scrub for public repo (github.com/cheyras/deckpal)

**Decided by:** user (via agent audit). The repo went public earlier this same day, so
this scrub trailed the exposure by hours; whether to also rewrite the already-public
history is a separate, still-open decision.

**What was removed/redacted:**
1. **Personal account data** — pkmn.gg account identifiers, collection-value figures,
   and a battle-log line tying the GitHub identity to the gaming account were redacted
   from `DECISIONS.md`. The two research files containing full account captures and
   collection-transfer planning (`research/AUTH-CAPTURES.md`,
   `research/COLLECTION-TRANSFER.md`) were deleted.
2. **Reverse-engineered API scraper** — the six `scripts/pkmn-*.mjs` scripts (extract,
   fetch-sets, enrich, import, tier-sync, verify) that authenticated against pkmn.gg's
   private API were deleted. Endpoint paths, auth-flow mechanics, and header-spoofing
   details were redacted from prose. The runbook referencing these scripts was never
   tracked (commit 1a1828b's message claimed removal of `research/pkmn-gg/` and
   `PKMN-SYNC-RUNBOOK.md`, but those were never committed -- that commit only added
   the LICENSE file).
3. **Third-party names** — a co-hosted database name and role identifying a real person
   were replaced with generic labels across all files.
4. **Infrastructure fingerprinting** — the original [Project Brief](https://github.com/cheyras/deckpal/wiki/Project-Brief)'s exhaustive port inventory of the
   entire host was trimmed to DeckPal's own 3700-3709 block; SSO postmortem
   specifics (filesystem paths, uid, secret filenames) were reduced to the lesson only.
5. **Dangling references** — all pointers to deleted files were updated across the tree
   (code comments, research docs, skills, specs). Source-capture citations in code
   retain the formula evidence but no longer reference the removed file.
6. **Defense-in-depth** — `issues/*/*.jpg` added to `.gitignore`.

**Why:** the repo went public. Personal account data, reverse-engineered API tooling,
third-party names, and detailed infrastructure internals have no place in a public
codebase. The engineering lessons and verified formulas are preserved; only the
private specifics are gone.
