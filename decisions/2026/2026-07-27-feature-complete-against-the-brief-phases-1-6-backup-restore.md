## 2026-07-27 — Feature-complete against the brief (Phases 1–6 + backup/restore)

All verified against the live deployed stack:
- ✅ Phase 4 Lists (dynamic/static/pokédex-binder, read-through progress)
- ✅ Phase 5 Deck builder (engine 27/27 tests; reprint-legality proven correct in the
  live "Not Legal" panel; PTCGL import/export; test-hand; buy-missing)
- ✅ Phase 6 Insights (Trainer Level floor(unique/10), collection value USD/EUR,
  honest cold-start value chart), Pokédex 1025-grid (real sprites, capture contrast),
  profile/showcase
- ✅ Phase 7 backup/restore + CSV/JSON/PTCGL export (restore-drill row-matched prod)

**Build bug found+fixed:** `tsc` didn't copy the deck engine's vendored `data/*.json`
to dist → built app crash-looped on ENOENT (latent: engine only ran under tsx before).
`apps/api` build now copies `src/deck/data` → `dist/deck/data`.

**Remaining (consent-gated / optional), NOT done:**
- Split-horizon DNS + PWA/offline polish (approved in principle; needs the DNS
  flip — riskiest change, rewrites hostname resolution for all services). Deferred.
- Schedule the nightly backup cron (`scripts/backup.sh` @ 04:15) — one crontab line.
- Phase 8 optional: card scanner, stream overlay, PDF export — not started.
- Demo state: 4 owned base1 holos + 1 demo list + 1 demo deck left in place so the
  gamification surfaces are non-empty. Zero on request.
