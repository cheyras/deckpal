## Phase 2 progress (data backbone)

- ✅ **Task 1 — scaffold + DB.** pnpm workspace mirroring the host API layout; `pokedex`
  DB + non-superuser role on host Postgres; 60 tables / 5 views / 95 indexes from
  `SCHEMA.md`; role-scoped tuning only; `.env` 600 + gitignored; 2 commits on
  `main`. Independently re-verified by lead. Caught + fixed 5 real SCHEMA.md
  defects (2 would have hard-failed: `sync_run.kind` and `list_item.card_id`
  indexes on nonexistent columns; `is_synthesized` undeclared; price_source
  id/code inconsistency; append-only REVOKE is a no-op on an owner-held table —
  needs a trigger later).
- ✅ **Variant-coverage risk RESOLVED** (`research/TCGCSV-VARIANTS.md`). The
  ~6,275-card reverse-holo gap (Call of Legends / B&W / XY / Sun&Moon) is real and
  fillable from TCGCSV `subTypeName` at 89.6–100% join, **zero false positives** on
  controls. Cross-filled rows: `source='tcgcsv'`, `tcgdex_variant_id=NULL`, key on
  `(card_id, variant_kind_code)` so a later TCGdex backfill promotes in place via
  `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`. Numeric-join fills count immediately; cleanName-fallback
  fills marked provisional. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` §8.1.
- ✅ **Task 2 — catalog importer.** Whole catalog imported and **independently
  re-verified by lead**: 23,444 cards ✓, 35,719 variant rows ✓ (35,648 upstream − 4
  intra-card exact-dup facet tuples + 75 synthesized), 75 synthesized ✓, all
  `source='tcgdex'`, 0 dupes on `(card_id, variant_kind_code)`, exactly 1 primary
  per card, connections back to baseline. Two-set seed: **base1 = 102 cards / 102
  standard pairs** (v3's exact prediction ✓); sv03.5 = 373 standard pairs;
  `base1-5` Clefairy display names match the authenticated captures incl.
  `Holofoil 1999-2000 Copyright`. The known reverse-holo gap (B&W/XY/CoL/Sun&Moon
  all ~1.0 var/card) is present as expected — Task 5 fills it.
  - **SCHEMA correction, verified:** `tcgdex_variant_id` is **not** a unique key —
    only **324 distinct values across 35,648 rows** (facet-tuple hash; `"generated"`
    sentinel = 10,296 rows). All three schema passes assumed it was the natural key.
    Repivoted onto `(card_id, variant_kind_code)`, the same key the cross-fill uses.
    Migration 014 dropped the bad UNIQUE and added `source`/`fill_confidence`.
    See `ARCHITECTURE.md` §8 correction note.
  - Left empty for now (no clean upstream): `card_subtype`, `card_tag`; 94 attacks /
    40 abilities with null names skipped (NOT NULL, incomplete upstream).
- 🔄 **Task 3 — image service :3701 + warmer** (in flight): build + 20-card smoke
  test only; full ~1.9 GB warm deferred to lead trigger.
- ⏳ **Task 4 — dex importer** (held until catalog import completes; needs `card`).
- ⏳ **Task 5 — price ingest** (TCGCSV + Cardmarket + the reverse-holo cross-fill;
  needs catalog imported for the numeric join).
- ⏳ **Task 6 — offline proof** + two-set end-to-end demo for the user.
