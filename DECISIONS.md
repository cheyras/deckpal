# pokedex — Decision Log

Running log of locked decisions. Each entry: date, decision, who decided, why.
`ARCHITECTURE.md` is the synthesis; this file is the audit trail.

---

## 2026-07-24 — Remote access: existing nginx + the SSO gate
**Decided by:** user.
**Decision:** pokedex will be reachable remotely via a route on the existing
`example.invalid` nginx vhost, gated by the SSO gate — the same pattern the
other services on this box already use. Tailscale will **not** be installed.

**Implications:**
- No new daemon on the Pi; reuses a proven, already-operating pattern.
- The app binds to localhost / LAN only; nginx is the sole ingress.
- The app itself needs no login of its own — the SSO gate is the auth boundary.
  It must therefore never be bound to `0.0.0.0` on a routable interface.
- LAN access goes through the `the-original-host` vhost as usual.
- Requires a new `location` block in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/brain-public`
  and in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/the-original-host`. **Do not reload nginx without
  asking the user** (per project CLAUDE.md — six pm2 services depend on it).

## 2026-07-24 — Users: single-user now, multi-user-ready schema
**Decided by:** user.
**Decision:** Ship as a single-user app — no login screen, one collection, one
profile. But every user-owned row (collection entries, lists, decks, profile,
trainer level, pokédex captures) carries a `user_id` FK from day one, seeded
with a single default user.

**Implications:**
- No auth code, no session handling, no user-management UI in any phase.
- Schema and API handlers thread `user_id` through from the start so adding a
  second person later is a config change plus an auth layer, not a migration of
  every table.
- Catalog tables (sets, cards, variants, prices) are global — never user-scoped.
- Do **not** let this leak into the UI as user-switching affordances.

---

## 2026-07-24 — Never run the self-hosted TCGdex API
**Decided by:** lead agent, on measured evidence (`research/DATA-LAYER.md`).
**Decision:** We do **not** run `tcgdex/cards-database`'s API server, in any
phase, even ad hoc. We extract the compiled catalog JSON from the published
image (`docker save` streamed through `tar`, no container ever created) and
import it directly into our own DB.

**Why:** their server statically `import`s all 18 languages' `cards.json`
(161 MB) into an in-memory dict **per cluster worker**, and forks one worker per
core. Measured JSON→object expansion on this Pi is **6.4×** (27.24 MB → 172.6 MB
peak RSS). Stock defaults would want ~2.5–4.5 GB on a box with ~3.7 GB
available, alongside the legacy git host, nginx, six pm2 services and six containers. This is
the most likely cause of the crash that preceded this session.

**Implications:** the BRIEF's §3a instruction to "stand up a local TCGdex API
container as the upstream" is **superseded** — it is a live hazard to this box,
not merely suboptimal. If it is ever genuinely needed for a one-off, the only
sanctioned form is `MAX_WORKERS=1` + `--memory=1.5g` on port 3702, stopped
immediately after. Extraction is only ~29.75 MB of English JSON, so there is no
real reason to.

## 2026-07-24 — Port block 3700–3709, localhost-bound
**Decided by:** lead agent. 3700 API, 3701 image service, 3702 reserved,
3703 dev server. All bound to `127.0.0.1`, fronted by the existing nginx vhosts.
Verified free via `ss -tln`. (Note: the BRIEF's Part B port list is stale in both
directions — 3597/4700/5250/9091 are listed as taken but are not bound, while
3600 and 36793 are bound and unlisted.)

## 2026-07-24 — microSD is not the constraint the brief assumed
**Decided by:** lead agent, on measured evidence. **No SSD purchase required.**
TCGdex serves **WebP natively**, so the full English corpus at both resolutions
is **1.87 GB** — not the 20+ GB the brief's PNG-based estimate implied
(`high.png` alone would be 19.2 GB). Measured over 59 random cards spanning
every era. AVIF re-encode was benchmarked on-Pi and **rejected**: 620 MB saved
for 41 minutes of full 4-core load.

Write wear: the box already writes **6.84 GB/day at idle** (measured over a 180 s
`/proc/diskstats` window). pokedex adds ~55 MB/day steady-state, +0.8%, plus a
one-time ~2 GB ingest. **Wear from this project is not a real risk.** The real
risks on this box are the existing write baseline and the absence of a backup —
worth raising with the user as a separate concern from pokedex.

Image cache: WebP only, both resolutions, eager full warm (43,656 GETs @ 5 rps
≈ 2.4 h), 4 GB cap, LRU eviction on `high` only.

## 2026-07-24 — Stack: match the box, not the brief
**Decided by:** user, at the Phase 1 checkpoint.
**Decision:** Node/TS API + pm2 + an nginx location block, matching the six
existing first-party services. The BRIEF's Python 3.11 + FastAPI and its named
`docker-compose.arm64.yml` deliverable are **superseded**; the deliverable becomes
a pm2 `ecosystem.config.cjs` fragment + nginx config.

**Why:** same operational shape and debugging path (`pm2 logs pokedex-*`) as
everything else the user runs; no container memory overhead on a box that recently
OOM'd; and it dissolves the BRIEF Part B constraint 7 (Python 3.13 vs 3.11)
entirely. Docker remains in use on this box only for third-party appliances.

## 2026-07-24 — Database: host Postgres, dedicated DB + role
**Decided by:** user, at the Phase 1 checkpoint.
**Decision:** a dedicated `pokedex` database and role on the existing host
Postgres 17.9, application pool capped at **3** connections. All tuning
role-scoped. **No `postgresql.conf` change and no Postgres restart.**

**Why:** `max_connections` is 20 with 10 already in use by the a co-hosted app/brain2db
apps — a 3-connection pool fits with 7 spare, so blast radius is zero. Marginal
RAM 25–35 MB vs ~180–250 MB for a second instance. Postgres also gives the price
time-series range partitioning and BRIN, which SQLite cannot.

**Implications:** pokedex is now coupled to the same Postgres as the brain apps.
Mitigations: cap the pool at 3 and never raise it without re-checking headroom;
scope every setting to the role; and **backup/restore must cover the `pokedex`
database specifically**, not the whole cluster.

## 2026-07-24 — LAN HTTPS via split-horizon DNS
**Decided by:** user, at the Phase 1 checkpoint.
**Decision:** add a the local DNS resolver `address=/example.invalid/<pi-lan-ip>` entry
so the existing Let's Encrypt certificate serves LAN clients, making
`https://example.invalid/pokedex/` a **secure context** on the LAN.

**Why:** `http://localhost/` is plaintext, so service workers, install, and offline
are impossible there on every browser — which makes the BRIEF's PWA and
offline-resilience requirements unmeetable on LAN. This is the cheapest fix: no new
certificate, no new port, no external dependency.

**Implications — this touches shared infrastructure, so treat it carefully:**
- It changes DNS resolution for **every** service on this box, not just pokedex.
- Before changing anything: record how each existing service resolves today, make
  the change, then verify each one still resolves and still serves. Roll back on
  any regression.
- the SSO gate still gates the route; LAN clients will now traverse it too. Confirm
  that is acceptable, or add a LAN bypass deliberately rather than by accident.
- Scheduled for the hardening phase, **not** done casually mid-build.

### Related, box-wide (not a pokedex decision)
nginx `gzip_types` is commented out in `nginx.conf`, so JS/CSS/JSON are served
**uncompressed for every service on this machine** today. `gzip_static` is compiled
in; brotli is not. Any fix should be scoped to pokedex's own location blocks rather
than editing the global config — raised to the user as a separate observation.

## 2026-07-24 — Brain DBs fully isolated from the pokedex role
**Decided by:** user. **Done and verified by lead.**
`REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE a co-hosted app, brain2db FROM PUBLIC`, with explicit
`GRANT CONNECT … TO ob1 / brain2` so the owners are unaffected. Verified: the
pokedex role now gets `FATAL: permission denied` connecting to either brain DB
(it could before); owners retain CONNECT (`has_database_privilege` = true); both
apps' live connections held at 5+5 unbroken across the change. `datacl` is now
`{=T/<owner>,<owner>=CTc/<owner>}` — PUBLIC keeps TEMP only.

## Phase 2 progress (data backbone)

- ✅ **Task 1 — scaffold + DB.** pnpm workspace mirroring `the-original-host-api`; `pokedex`
  DB + non-superuser role on host Postgres; 60 tables / 5 views / 95 indexes from
  `SCHEMA.md`; role-scoped tuning only; `.env` 600 + gitignored; 2 commits on
  `main`. Independently re-verified by lead. Caught + fixed 5 real SCHEMA.md
  defects (2 would have hard-failed: `sync_run.kind` and `list_item.card_id`
  indexes on nonexistent columns; `is_synthesized` undeclared; price_source
  id/code inconsistency; append-only REVOKE is a no-op on an owner-held table —
  needs a trigger later).
- ✅ **Variant-coverage risk RESOLVED** (`research/TCGCSV-VARIANTS.md`). The
  ~6,275-card reverse-holo gap (Call of Legends / B&W / XY / Sun&Moon) is real and
  fillable from TCGCSV `subTypeName` at 89.6–100% join, **zero false positives** on
  controls. Cross-filled rows: `source='tcgcsv'`, `tcgdex_variant_id=NULL`, key on
  `(card_id, variant_kind_code)` so a later TCGdex backfill promotes in place via
  `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`. Numeric-join fills count immediately; cleanName-fallback
  fills marked provisional. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` §8.1.
- ✅ **Task 2 — catalog importer.** Whole catalog imported and **independently
  re-verified by lead**: 23,444 cards ✓, 35,719 variant rows ✓ (35,648 upstream − 4
  intra-card exact-dup facet tuples + 75 synthesized), 75 synthesized ✓, all
  `source='tcgdex'`, 0 dupes on `(card_id, variant_kind_code)`, exactly 1 primary
  per card, connections back to baseline. Two-set seed: **base1 = 102 cards / 102
  standard pairs** (v3's exact prediction ✓); sv03.5 = 373 standard pairs;
  `base1-5` Clefairy display names match the authenticated captures incl.
  `Holofoil 1999-2000 Copyright`. The known reverse-holo gap (B&W/XY/CoL/Sun&Moon
  all ~1.0 var/card) is present as expected — Task 5 fills it.
  - **SCHEMA correction, verified:** `tcgdex_variant_id` is **not** a unique key —
    only **324 distinct values across 35,648 rows** (facet-tuple hash; `"generated"`
    sentinel = 10,296 rows). All three schema passes assumed it was the natural key.
    Repivoted onto `(card_id, variant_kind_code)`, the same key the cross-fill uses.
    Migration 014 dropped the bad UNIQUE and added `source`/`fill_confidence`.
    See `ARCHITECTURE.md` §8 correction note.
  - Left empty for now (no clean upstream): `card_subtype`, `card_tag`; 94 attacks /
    40 abilities with null names skipped (NOT NULL, incomplete upstream).
- 🔄 **Task 3 — image service :3701 + warmer** (in flight): build + 20-card smoke
  test only; full ~1.9 GB warm deferred to lead trigger.
- ⏳ **Task 4 — dex importer** (held until catalog import completes; needs `card`).
- ⏳ **Task 5 — price ingest** (TCGCSV + Cardmarket + the reverse-holo cross-fill;
  needs catalog imported for the numeric join).
- ⏳ **Task 6 — offline proof** + two-set end-to-end demo for the user.

## Phase 3 progress (the app)

- ✅ **Task 1 — read API** (`apps/api` :3700, `/pokedex/api/*`). Lead-verified against
  live data: base1 goals 102/102/409; sv03.5 goals 207/373/384 (Master<Grandmaster,
  distinct pair fractions); `base1-4` Charizard 4 composed variants, Holofoil
  `market` $800.43 USD / €421.11 EUR with full price object (low/mid/high/directLow/
  trend/avg1-7-30, pricedAt, isFallback); dex charizard gen1 fire/flying 124 cards.
  12 filter facets populated; **Sub-Type empty** (card_subtype/card_tag not imported).
  Contract in `API.md`. Cleanup verified (port free, connections baseline).
  - Notable: `tcgplayer_url` NULL on tcgdex variants (compose from product_id);
    `dex_species.total_card_count`=0 (computed live); prices integer minor units.
- ✅ **Task 2 — React frontend** (browse MVP). Lead-viewed screenshots: set grid,
  binder (9-pocket spread, inside cover, Slot #N), card detail — all faithful to
  pkmn.gg / the authenticated captures. React 19.2 + Vite 8.1 + Tailwind 4.3 +
  TanStack Router/Query/Virtual. Builds on the Pi in ~0.4s, 114 KB gzip. Filter/
  sort/goal/view state in the URL (verified round-trip). Honest divergences baked
  in: "as of {date}" freshness, "no affiliate relationship", labelled Master bar.
- ✅ **Task 3 — collection mutation.** Write endpoints + wired steppers, optimistic
  UI. **Lead-verified the tier arithmetic directly against the endpoints:** own
  Charizard Holofoil (standard) → Complete/Master/Grandmaster all 0→1; own its
  1st-Ed-Shadowless (special) → **only Grandmaster** 1→2. Reset clean. This proves
  the whole three-goal model end to end. `recomputeSetProgress` in `apps/api` also
  becomes the basis for the still-stubbed nightly reconcile sweep.
  - Follow-up: `PATCH quantity:0` leaves a zero-qty `collection_item` row where
    `increment`-to-0 deletes it — normalize to delete-on-zero.

**Phase 3 MVP is functionally complete:** browse (series→set→card→binder) + own
cards + live three-goal progress + search/filter/sort in URL + prices + dex + local
images. It runs from manually-started node processes; **it is NOT yet deployed**
(no pm2 unit, no nginx route) — that touches shared infra and needs user consent.

## 2026-07-27 — Deployment (Phase 7, partial): LAN live; HTTPS/remote blocked by a pre-existing the SSO gate failure

**Applied and verified (reversible):**
- **pm2:** `pokedex-api` :3700, `pokedex-images` :3701, `pokedex-sync` (cron) — all
  online, `pm2 save`d (survive reboot). Config: `deploy/ecosystem.pokedex.config.cjs`.
- **API serves the SPA** (`apps/web/dist` + client-route fallback), matching the
  box's proxy-not-static convention — so nginx never needs to traverse the 700 `$HOME`
  (and `setfacl` isn't installed anyway).
- **nginx LAN vhost** (`the-original-host`): one `include` line added after `server_name`
  → `deploy/nginx-the-original-host-pokedex.conf`. **`http://localhost/pokedex/` works now**,
  verified in a browser end-to-end (nginx→api→images, real art, all 200), and
  git/a co-hosted app/a co-hosted app/root all still 200.
- **nginx public vhost** (`brain-public` :443): one `include` after the
  the SSO gate-authrequest include → `deploy/nginx-brain-public-pokedex.conf`
  (the SSO gate-gated). Config correct (`nginx -t` clean).

**✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-27 (user asked):** root cause was `/etc/the SSO gate/secrets/`
having lost its owner **execute** bit (`drw-r-----`) — the owner (the SSO gate, uid 980)
could not traverse the dir to read `smtp_password`, so it died at config load on the
last boot. Fix: `chmod u+x /etc/the SSO gate/secrets` (surgical; file contents untouched).
`systemctl start the SSO gate` → active, 9091 listening, portal 200. All gated routes
recovered (`/git/`, `/pokedex/`, MCP endpoints now 302→portal instead of 500). If the
x-bit is stripped again on a future boot, investigate what does it — the perm fix
itself is persistent and the unit is `enabled`.

**🔴 Pre-existing blocker (NOT caused by pokedex): `the SSO gate.service` is `failed`.**
Port 9091 isn't listening; every the SSO gate-gated route 500s — `/git/` 500s with the
pokedex include *removed*, proving it's the SSO gate, not us. This blocks ALL remote/
gated access on the box, not just pokedex. **Lead did not restart it** — it's the
user's auth infra and it failed for an unknown reason. Until it's back:
  - LAN **HTTP** access works fully (the LAN vhost has no the SSO gate).
  - Remote HTTPS + the LAN-HTTPS/PWA path (via `example.invalid`) will 500.

**⏸ Deferred: split-horizon the local DNS resolver (Stage D).** `deploy/the local DNS resolver-pokedex.conf` is
ready (`address=/example.invalid/10.0.0.1`), but its only benefit —
HTTPS secure-context on LAN for the PWA — requires the SSO gate up to verify, and it's
the riskiest change (rewrites DNS resolution of that hostname for every service).
Not worth flipping DNS for an unverifiable, currently-500ing target. Apply after
the SSO gate is healthy.

**Rollback:** vhost backups at `scratchpad/{the-original-host,brain-public}.bak`; remove the
two `include` lines + `nginx -t` + reload; `pm2 delete pokedex-api pokedex-images
pokedex-sync && pm2 save`.

## Phase 2 follow-ups (found during verification, non-blocking)

- ✅ **Task 4 — dex importer** and ✅ **Task 5 — price ingest + cross-fill**, both
  lead-verified against the DB. Cross-fill: 4,285 tcgcsv reverse rows,
  **0 false positives** on control sets (sm3 all-tcgdex, sv03.5 zero tcgcsv);
  reverse-holo trap proven (`swsh3-136` `-holo` prices land on `reverse`);
  `captured_at` = source stamp not `now()`; re-runs add 0. Full catalog now priced:
  **32,948 distinct priced variants across 187 sets**.
- 🐛 **`prices --sets <x>` does not scope the TCGCSV group walk.** A targeted
  `tcgcsv --sets base1 --force` ran the full 178-group sync. Harmless for the daily
  cron (all groups run together, idempotent), but the flag is misleading for
  targeted/incremental runs. Fix before relying on partial price runs.
- 🐛 **Skip-if-unchanged gate is global, not per-set.** Because the gate keys on the
  source `last-updated.txt` stamp, a set absent from the first run of the day never
  gets priced until the stamp advances — unless `--force`. Fine for the full daily
  job; wrong for incremental. Consider per-(job,set) stamping.
- ⚠️ **base1 priced 102 of 300 product-matched variants.** The printing-aware join
  `(tcgplayer_product_id, tcgplayer_printing) ↔ (productId, subTypeName)` may be
  dropping variants whose `tcgplayer_printing` is null/mismatched. Price *coverage*
  (not correctness) needs a look — vintage sets are the likely weak spot.
- 📝 **Schema asymmetries flagged by the price agent** (not blockers): the
  field-map's base `avg → target_finish='holo'` row is not literally usable (routed
  in code for the base bucket, field-map used as authority for reverse only);
  `price_observation.source_code` is SMALLINT→id while `price_current.source_code`
  is TEXT→code. Reconcile in a later migration.
- 📝 **`card_species_conflict`**: the dex importer seeded `resolved_to` for the 13
  known-wrong cards (treating the curated seed as the human decision). The
  *recurring* sync must still never clobber a human `resolved_to`.
- ⏳ **`dex_species.total_card_count`** left 0 (level denominator) — catalog sync
  follow-up.

## Open — pending Phase 1 research
- **Storage engine** — data-layer research recommends the **host Postgres 17.9**
  with a dedicated `pokedex` DB + role and a pool capped at 3 connections
  (marginal RAM 25–35 MB, vs ~180–250 MB for a second instance, vs ~0 for
  SQLite). Decisive point: `max_connections = 20` with **10 already in use** by
  the a co-hosted app/brain2db apps, so a 3-connection pool fits with 7 spare —
  **no config change, no Postgres restart, zero blast radius**. Honest
  counter-argument: every other pm2 app on this box uses SQLite, and sharing
  Postgres with the brain apps couples pokedex to them. **User decision.**
- **Backend language** — the BRIEF says Python 3.11 + FastAPI, but all six
  existing pm2 services are Node/TS, `bun` is not installed, and Node is
  v20.20.2. A single-language Node/TS stack also dissolves the BRIEF's Python
  3.13 concern entirely. Leaning Node/TS. **User decision.**
- **Deployment shape** — Docker Compose (a named BRIEF deliverable,
  `docker-compose.arm64.yml`) vs pm2 + nginx (this box's actual convention, per
  `/home/cheyras/CLAUDE.md`). Leaning pm2 + `ecosystem.config.cjs` + an nginx
  location block. This **changes a named deliverable**, so it is the user's call.
- **Fork `pokecollector` vs build clean** — `PRIOR-ART.md` verdict is *borrow
  heavily, do not fork, build the shell clean*. Lead agent concurs; recorded
  here for user visibility rather than as an open question.
- **Authenticated pkmn.gg capture session** — roughly half the open questions in
  `research/BEHAVIOR-SPEC.md` §15 only close from a logged-in session (the
  Master-vs-Grandmaster variant boundary, the `Dupes` predicate, vintage variant
  names, shiny threshold, Pokédex Binder semantics, a real PTCGL export). Several
  are Pro-tier gated. Needs a user decision — does the user have an account, and
  do they want us driving it?

## 2026-07-24 — Sprites are fetched, never committed
**Decided by:** lead agent (flagged by dex research; user may override).
**Decision:** Pokémon sprites and official artwork are pulled at setup time by a
fetch script pinned to a specific `PokeAPI/sprites` commit SHA, into the same
kind of local cache as card art. They are **not** vendored into the git repo.

**Why:** `PokeAPI/sprites/LICENCE.txt` asserts CC0 1.0 on one line and
"All image contents within are Copyright The Pokémon Company" on the next —
CC0 applied to work the applier does not own, so the CC0 grant is not the
author's to make. Card art is in exactly the same position. Caching Nintendo/TPC
assets on your own disk for personal use is the brief's accepted posture;
*committing* them into a git repo that lives on a publicly-reachable the legacy git host is a
materially different act. Keeping them out of git costs us nothing (a sparse
blobless checkout is ~270 MB and scripted) and removes the question entirely.

**Implications:** setup is a documented two-step (clone, then `fetch-assets`).
Backup/restore must cover the asset cache separately from the DB, and the
restore drill must prove a fresh Pi can re-fetch.

## Corrections to the BRIEF forced by Phase 1 research

Recorded so they are not silently re-introduced later:

1. **"Main set vs master set" is stale.** pkmn.gg now has *three* goals —
   Complete / Master / Grandmaster. **Confirmed in the shipped UI**, not just the
   changelog: Account Settings → `Default Collecting Goal` presents all three with
   descriptions, on a **non-Pro account** (`research/AUTH-CAPTURES.md` §8).
   Model three.
   - Refinement from observation: bar 1 is always Complete Set; **bar 2 is Master,
     or Grandmaster when Grandmaster is selected — never a copy of Complete.**
     So we store **three** progress counters per (user, set) and render two bars.
   - Master % is a **(card, variant) pair fraction**, not a card fraction —
     no integer over 120 yields the observed 9.3%. Base Set 2 corroborates: one
     printing per card, so both bars read 22.3%.
   - **Label the second bar.** pkmn.gg does not, and the account owner could not
     find the feature at all as a result.
2. **"Shinies via extra copies" is wrong.** Species level is driven by *unique*
   cards featuring that species, not duplicate copies. Species association is
   many-to-many (tag-team cards appear under both species).
3. **"Variants: 1st edition / shadowless"** — ~~these appear nowhere in any
   capture~~. **Half retracted 2026-07-24.** They were absent only because every
   capture was signed-out. They exist as **composed** names — `1st Edition Holofoil
   Shadowless`, `Unlimited Holofoil Shadowless` — with grammar `[stamp] [foil]
   [print-run subtype]`, and they compose from TCGdex facets we already hold
   (`stamp=1st-edition` 943, `subtype=shadowless` 204, `subtype=unlimited` 102).

   Still true: the **pack-pulled flag exists in no upstream source**, so the
   derivation stays. But we now know its exact UI semantic. Each variant carries a
   provenance line, and only three distinct strings exist across 37 authenticated
   screenshots:
   - `Found in Booster Packs` — the base print run
   - `Found in First Print Run Booster Packs`
   - `Found in Shadowless Print Run Booster Packs`

   Grammar: `Found in {printRun} Booster Packs`, printRun omitted for the base run.
   So the flag is **not a boolean** — it identifies *which print run*, and
   `variant_kind.tier_derived` should key on print-run identity.

   The "additional" tier is named three ways for the same set: `Other Variants`
   (card detail), `Additional Variants` (binder), and "promos, stamped cards, and
   special prints" (settings).
4. **TCGdex has no batch price endpoint** — pricing is one HTTP request per
   card. This reshapes the sync design and promotes TCGCSV from "redundancy" to
   a primary price path. Source: `PRIOR-ART.md`.
5. **TCGdex Cardmarket `*-holo` fields mean *reverse holo*, not holo finish.**
   Verified live on `swsh3-136`. Reading them literally ships wrong prices.
6. **"Prefer forking pokecollector"** — verdict is *borrow, don't fork*; its
   variant and price-history schemas are structurally wrong for this brief.
   AGPL-3.0 is explicitly not the blocker for a private single-user box.
7. **"Both prior projects hotlink images"** — false. pokecollector caches into a
   Postgres BYTEA table with no eviction, TTL, or size cap.
8. **"Binder solved twice, don't differentiate"** — solved once, in the
   unlicensed project. The 9-pocket positioned binder is ours to build.

## 2026-07-27 — Feature-complete against the brief (Phases 1–6 + backup/restore)

All verified against the LIVE deployed stack (http://localhost/pokedex/):
- ✅ Phase 4 Lists (dynamic/static/pokédex-binder, read-through progress)
- ✅ Phase 5 Deck builder (engine 27/27 tests; reprint-legality proven correct in the
  live "Not Legal" panel; PTCGL import/export; test-hand; buy-missing)
- ✅ Phase 6 Insights (Trainer Level floor(unique/10), collection value USD/EUR,
  honest cold-start value chart), Pokédex 1025-grid (real sprites, capture contrast),
  profile/showcase
- ✅ Phase 7 backup/restore + CSV/JSON/PTCGL export (restore-drill row-matched prod)

**Build bug found+fixed:** `tsc` didn't copy the deck engine's vendored `data/*.json`
to dist → built app crash-looped on ENOENT (latent: engine only ran under tsx before).
`apps/api` build now copies `src/deck/data` → `dist/deck/data`.

**Remaining (consent-gated / optional), NOT done:**
- Split-horizon the local DNS resolver + PWA/offline polish (approved in principle; needs the DNS
  flip — riskiest change, rewrites hostname resolution for all services). Deferred.
- Schedule the nightly backup cron (`scripts/backup.sh` @ 04:15) — one crontab line.
- Phase 8 optional: card scanner, stream overlay, PDF export — not started.
- Demo state: 4 owned base1 holos + 1 demo list + 1 demo deck left in place so the

## 2026-07-27 — Split-horizon DNS + backup cron applied (user: "all of the above")

- **Split-horizon DNS DONE.** `/etc/the local DNS resolver.d/pokedex.conf` = `address=/example.invalid/10.0.0.1` (mirrors the existing Minecraft split-horizon entries). `the local DNS resolver --test` OK → restarted. Verified: hostname → Pi LAN IP via the local DNS resolver; Minecraft entries + external DNS (github) still resolve; **LAN HTTPS serves a VALID cert** (curl without -k → 302 the SSO gate gate, not a cert error) → secure context enabled → PWA now possible on LAN. `/git/` + the SSO gate portal still serve over the LAN path. Rollback: `rm /etc/the local DNS resolver.d/pokedex.conf && systemctl restart the local DNS resolver`.
- **Backup cron DONE.** User crontab: `15 4 * * * bash scripts/backup.sh` (between the 03:00 fuel + 05:00 karakeep jobs). Script already proven (valid dump + restore-drill).
- **In flight:** catalog-imagery fill (set logos/symbols warm + image-service route + frontend wiring — the "unpopulated/empty" fix) and PDF export backend.
- **Queued (web-file-collision-serialized, after imagery lands):** PWA manifest+SW (now unblocked by LAN HTTPS), stream overlay, card scanner, wire PDF buttons. **Then** zero demo data to pristine baseline (held last so the PDF agent can test against the demo deck/list).

## 2026-07-27 — "All of the above" complete + pristine baseline

Every remaining item done and lead-verified against the live stack:
- ✅ Split-horizon DNS + LAN HTTPS (valid cert) · ✅ nightly backup cron
- ✅ Set imagery filled (326 logos/symbols, series index, set headers) — the "empty" fix
- ✅ PDF export (deck/list/set checklist) + UI buttons
- ✅ PWA (manifest, SW, offline shell+visited-art, iOS mitigations)
- ✅ Card scanner (perceptual-hash, 21,828-card index, ImageMagick decode, no native deps) + UI (upload/camera → match → add), verified dist-0 exact match
- ✅ Stream overlay (transparent OBS source at /pokedex/overlay)
- ✅ **Demo data zeroed to pristine** (collection/lists/decks/events/value-points/dex/progress all 0; catalog + prices + sprites + set imagery intact; app_user seeded). Empty-state endpoints all 200.

**Genuine follow-ups (not done, by design/limitation):**
1. Energy-type icons on cards — no local/derivable source; needs 11 hand-authored SVGs (design work).
2. Overlay names no card — needs a `GET /collection/events` read endpoint (activity feed exists in DB, no route); currently watches owned-count deltas only.
3. BW/XY-era ACE SPEC sublist (10 names) vendored from public docs, not DB-derivable — flagged in deck engine `data/_provenance.json` for refresh.
4. Offline is tiered (shell + visited art + collection), not full-catalog — deliberate on a phone.
5. Remote HTTPS (example.invalid/pokedex/) works via the SSO gate.

## 2026-07-27 — Correction: git history is clean (no entanglement)
An earlier note called e0e5fd4 "entangled" from the concurrent Phase 7/8 commit race.
**Verified false:** e0e5fd4 contains scanner files ONLY (apps/api/scan, index.ts,
migration 016, package.json); bb46766 (PWA) and 7ace0c6 (web wave) each contain 0
non-web files. The scanner agent's `reset --mixed` + scoped re-commit fully corrected
the race; the transient bad SHA (7e5237d) never survived into history. Nothing to fix.

## 2026-07-28 — Collection migrated from pkmn.gg (100% faithful) + catalog gaps modelled

The user's real pkmn.gg collection (account **[redacted]**) is imported. **389 (card,variant)
rows / 835 cards across 23 English sets — 0 in the review bucket.**

**Extraction.** pkmn.gg's backend is `[redacted host]/pkmn`. The authoritative endpoints
(discovered from the SPA bundle + session):
- `GET /v1/collection?setId=<id>` — real per-set ownership `{cardId, variant, quantity}`.
  The `/v1/collection/recent` feed in the user's XHR sample was a *views* feed (all
  quantities 0) — **not** ownership; the gating risk is resolved by using the per-set GET.
- `GET /v1/card/<setId>` — authoritative full per-card `variantMap` (incl. `tcgPlayerId`,
  `tcgPlayerSubtype`, and a `type: Primary|Secondary` flag = pkmn's master-tier boundary).
- `GET /v1/set` — all 649 sets (211 EN / 21 Pocket-EN / 417 JP). Swept the 211 EN only.
- `POST /v1/auth/refresh` with `Cookie: refresh_token=…` mints a fresh access token
  (rotates the refresh token). Access JWT lives ~15 min; the extractor auto-refreshes.
Scripts: `scripts/pkmn-extract.mjs` (sweep → `~/Transfer/pkmn-collection-full.jsonl`,
durable, gitignored), `scripts/pkmn-import.mjs` (resolve + dry-run/`--commit`, idempotent
SET-quantity upsert + `collection_event` + `recomputeSetProgress`). Session/token files
live in `~/Transfer/` only — never committed or logged.

**Mapping.** Card: pkmn `cardId` → our `card.tcgdex_id` via a set crosswalk
(`sv3pt5`→`sv03.5`, `sv8pt5`→`sv08.5`, `sv10pt5_blk`→`sv10.5b`, `sve23`→`sve`, `misc-MEW`→
`miscp-001` "Ancient Mew") + numeric `local_id` join (survives zero-padding). Variant:
primaries (normal/holofoil/reverseHolofoil) → the card's **plainest standard-tier** variant
of that finish (this is pkmn's "bare name = base print run" semantic — Base Set Holofoil →
`holo-unlimited`, Fossil Normal → `normal-foil-galaxy`); facet keys (1st-edition, poké-ball,
stamps) require the exact facet.

**Catalog gap fixed (`scripts/pkmn-enrich.mjs`).** TCGdex under-catalogues reverse-holos:
**me04 Chaos Rising had 0 reverse variants** (siblings me01–03 have ~1.9/card) — a real
ingest gap, NOT a new set. Modelled the missing variants from pkmn.gg's authoritative
variantMap, tagged `source='pkmn.gg'` (fully reversible: `DELETE … WHERE source='pkmn.gg'`).
Added `pkmn.gg` to the `card_variant.source` CHECK and one new `variant_kind`
(`holo-stamp-trick-or-trade`). Result verified against pkmn's own `set-stats`: me04 reverse
0→**76**, me05→**74** — Complete + Grandmaster now match pkmn.gg **exactly** on every ME set;
Master matches 5/6 (me01 off by **2**, see below).

**Known residual (not a bug):** our global v3 tier rule marks every plain `normal` as
standard, but pkmn flags the `normal` of two holo-rare cards (me01-73 Hariyama, me01-74
Lunatone) as **Secondary** (grandmaster-only) — so our me01 Master reads 12 vs pkmn's 10.
This is the documented pack-pulled-boundary derivation gap (§5). **Fixable** by ingesting
pkmn's `type: Primary/Secondary` flag into `variant_tier_override` catalog-wide — deferred
(a tier-system change, offered to the user). Also: pkmn.gg-modelled variants carry a
`tcgPlayerId` but no price row yet, so collection value ($746) slightly under-counts them.

Verified live (http://localhost/pokedex/) desktop + 390px: Pitch Black 38/120 · 31.7% ·
Master 22.4% (matches pkmn), Trainer Level 36, value [redacted]/[redacted], Pokédex 213/1025.
Import is idempotent — re-run picks up any future TCGdex reverse-holo backfill automatically.

## 2026-07-28 — Tier boundary synced to pkmn + prices + runbook (23/23 sets exact)

Closed out the three residuals from the import so the collection is **completely** faithful:

- **Tier sync (`scripts/pkmn-tier-sync.mjs`).** pkmn's per-card `variantMap[key].type`
  (`Primary`=Master / `Secondary`=Grandmaster-only) is the authoritative pack-pulled
  boundary. Ingested it into `variant_tier_override` (card-scoped, `asserted_by=
  'pkmn.gg-tier-sync'`) wherever our derived v3 rule disagreed — **260 overrides**. Two
  legitimate patterns (both correct, documented in the runbook §4): (1) holo-rare `normal`
  → Secondary (~40, e.g. me01 Hariyama/Lunatone — fixed the earlier me01 Master −2);
  (2) WOTC 1st-edition → Primary for Jungle/Fossil/Team Rocket (~209 — pkmn counts BOTH
  unlimited and 1st-ed printings as Master; Base Set is the exception since its 1st-ed is
  *also* Shadowless, correctly staying Secondary). Result: **23/23 owned sets now match
  pkmn.gg exactly on Complete + Master + Grandmaster** (`scripts/pkmn-verify.mjs`).
- **Prices.** Re-ran the TCGCSV ingest; the modelled standard variants (83 reverse + 9 holo
  with TCGplayer ids) are now priced. The ~11 promo variants without a TCGplayer id stay
  unpriced by design (no invented prices — SCHEMA §4.6).
- **New `card_variant.source` value `pkmn.gg`** added to the CHECK constraint (inline in
  `pkmn-enrich.mjs`); one new `variant_kind` `holo-stamp-trick-or-trade`.
- **Runbook: `PKMN-SYNC-RUNBOOK.md`** — the full procedure for a future agent on each new
  release (fetch pkmn variantMap → model missing variants → tier-sync → price → import →
  verify against set-stats), with the API map, the tier nuances, and per-step undo. New
  helper scripts: `pkmn-fetch-sets.mjs`, `pkmn-verify.mjs`. `HANDOFF-COLLECTION-IMPORT.md`
  is now superseded by the runbook.

## 2026-07-29 — In-app bug reporter + `fix-issues` skill

Added a **Report a bug** button to the top nav (`components/BugReport.tsx`, wired in
`AppShell` next to Scan). Clicking it captures a screenshot of the current view **before**
the modal opens (so the modal is never in the shot) via **html2canvas** (added as an
`apps/web` dep, **lazy-imported** so it stays out of the initial bundle — it splits into its
own ~47 KB-gzip chunk fetched only on first click), then opens a comment form. Submit POSTs
`{text, page, screenshot(JPEG dataURL), viewport, userAgent}` to **`POST /pokedex/api/bugs`**
(`routes/bugs.ts`), which writes each report to **`issues/<id>/`** in the repo (`report.md`
with YAML frontmatter + `screenshot.jpg`) — reports live in the codebase, not the DB. Raised
the app-wide `express.json` limit to 12 MB for the screenshot payload (every other route is
tiny; nginx already allows 50–100 MB on the pokedex locations). Screenshots are JPEG q0.85 of
the viewport region (~120 KB).

**Project skill `fix-issues`** (`.claude/skills/fix-issues/SKILL.md`): walks `issues/*/`,
reproduces each open issue from the comment + screenshot, fixes the root cause, **verifies in
a real browser (Playwright) at the reported viewport + 390px**, and only then deletes the
screenshot and flips `status: resolved` (keeping `report.md` as the audit trail). Hard rule:
never resolve without visual confirmation.

Verified end-to-end (Playwright, desktop 1280 + mobile 390): button renders, capture excludes
the modal, submit writes `issues/<id>/{report.md,screenshot.jpg}`, success toast → auto-close.

## 2026-07-29 — rotom-mcp: MCP server over the pokedex DB (`apps/mcp`)

New workspace app **`pokedex-mcp`** ("rotom-mcp", after the games' AI-assistant Pokémon):
an MCP streamable-HTTP server on **127.0.0.1:3704** giving Claude (Code / claude.ai / iOS)
14 tools + a `collection://summary` resource over the collection, catalog, prices, decks,
and lists. Design contract: `apps/mcp/SPEC.md`. Key decisions:

- **Hybrid data path.** Reads hit Postgres directly (compact MCP-shaped aggregation,
  precomputed views — `variant_tier_resolved`, `master_required_variant`,
  `user_set_progress` — never re-derived). All writes and every deck/list operation go
  through pokedex-api on :3700 so the transactional write logic (event append + progress
  recompute) and deck logic stay single-sourced.
- **Connection budget is now 4 TOTAL** (API 2 + sync 1 + **mcp 1**). Headroom re-checked
  against the 2026-07-24 measurement (7 spare); `makePool(1)`, `PGAPPNAME=pokedex-mcp`.
- **Migration 018** adds `source` (default `'web'`) + `note` to `collection_event`;
  the three collection write endpoints and `GET /collection/events` carry them. MCP
  writes are stamped `source='rotom-mcp'` — the "agentic logging" attribution. The
  append-only event log is unchanged otherwise.
- **SDK v2** (`@modelcontextprotocol/server@2.0.0`, released 2026-07-27 — the stable
  line): stateless `createMcpHandler`, fresh `McpServer` per request. Auth = house
  `x-brain-key` (fallback `?key=`), bare 401 (no `WWW-Authenticate` — claude.ai treats
  that header as an OAuth trigger). Host allowlist via `createMcpExpressApp`.
- **Ports**: 3704 (3702 stays the TCGdex escape-hatch slot, 3703 the dev server).
- **Write-tool policy** (`log_cards`): `dry_run` defaults true; ambiguity (card name or
  multi-owned-variant absolute set) is returned as candidates, never guessed; per-item
  partial failure; sequential API calls only.
- **Deploy fragments**: `deploy/nginx-the-original-host-rotom-mcp.conf` (LAN `/rotom/mcp`, app-layer
  key) and `deploy/nginx-brain-public-rotom-mcp.conf` (public `/rotom-mcp`, Anthropic CIDR
  `160.79.104.0/21` + nginx-injected key from `/etc/nginx/snippets/rotom-key.conf`, which
  holds the secret and lives OUTSIDE the repo). pm2 entry `pokedex-mcp` added to
  `ecosystem.config.cjs` (300M ceiling).
- **Bug found & fixed en route**: PTCGL name-only deck import 500'd — pg returns `DATE`
  as `Date` but `deck/db.ts` sorted `releasedOn` with `.localeCompare` (`CardFacts` claims
  ISO string). Normalized at the row boundary (`toFacts`).

## 2026-07-30 — snapshot-collection + reconcile cron jobs wired (HTTP to pokedex-api)

The last two daily cron stubs in `apps/sync` are now real: `snapshot-collection`
(21:00 UTC) and `reconcile` (01:00 UTC). Key decisions:

- **Wiring is HTTP, not import.** apps/sync must NOT import apps/api —
  `apps/api/src/db.ts` instantiates a 2-connection pool at module load, which inside
  the sync process would blow the 4-connection budget (sync gets 1). Same
  single-source principle as rotom-mcp (SPEC §3): logic stays in the API, sync calls
  two new internal endpoints — `POST /insights/value/snapshot` (→
  `snapshotCollectionValue`, idempotent per day) and `POST /collection/reconcile`
  (→ per-set `withTx(recomputeSetProgress)`, strictly sequential; 214 sets ≈ 1.1 s).
  Base URL `POKEDEX_API_BASE ?? http://127.0.0.1:3700/pokedex/api`, 120 s timeout.
- **`apps/sync/src/jobs/api-jobs.ts`** reuses the price jobs' plumbing: advisory lock
  (`tryLock`, clean skip if held), a `sync_run` row opened with
  `ON CONFLICT (job) WHERE status='running' DO NOTHING` (honours the
  `sync_run_one_active` partial unique index; conflict → log + skip), closed `ok`
  with `rows_written` (snapshot: `inserted`; reconcile: `sets`) or `failed` with the
  error. Errors re-throw; the scheduler's `runJob` catch is the crash barrier.
- **`run-once` CLI** (`pnpm --filter pokedex-sync run-once <job>`) runs any
  `REAL_JOBS` entry on a `makePool(1)` client; exits 1 on failure, 2 on bad job. To
  make `REAL_JOBS` importable, `apps/sync/src/index.ts` gained the same
  `pm_exec_path`/argv isMain guard as apps/api — importing it no longer boots the
  scheduler. Boot log now prints per-job REAL/stub roster (4 real; catalog / images /
  products-tcgcsv stay manual per PKMN-SYNC-RUNBOOK.md).
- **Proven live**: first snapshot run inserted 2 `collection_value_point` rows
  (2026-07-30: USD 77701, EUR 101151 minor); re-run inserted 0 (idempotent).
  Reconcile bumped all 642 `user_set_progress.reconciled_at` and changed **zero**
  derived values (full before/after dump diff empty). Dead-API run recorded
  `sync_run status='failed', error='fetch failed'`, exit 1, no orphaned running row.
- Also fixed the stale "NOT REGISTERED" header comment in `routes/insights.ts`
  (it has been mounted in index.ts since Phase 6 integration).
